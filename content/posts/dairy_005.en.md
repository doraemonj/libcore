Once upon a time, I was an employee of a state-owned enterprise in China, and no need to worry about life, but this is what I am worry about.

Is this really the life that I need not to worry about?

Is this world really not the cave of Plato's metaphor?

Do I really stay in the cage that is doomed to lock my destiny?

No.

It's the voice from my heart.

So I chose to quit my job at hometown and become a programmer who can traverse the isolation of the physical world simply by thoughts and insights.

Nice to see you, and nice to be seen by you.
